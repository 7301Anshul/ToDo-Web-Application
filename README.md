# ToDo-Web-Application
I have Created a Todo Web Application  In whch to-dos contain all of the tasks that you need to complete on a given day.
It's a great Application for managing time that enables you to lay out everything that you need to accomplish and plan and prioritize your day from there.

In this Project I have used Java, JSP, Servlet and For database connection i have used Hybernate.

1.In this Application we can Add Title and Content of the List and save them to the database. 

2. We can Edit the Post.

3. We can delete the Post.

Thanks
